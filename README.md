Check out [John Hammonds](https://x.com/_JohnHammond) video on backdooring the Cursor AI application with Loki C2! 🎩       
In the video he walks through discovering a new vulnerable Electron application, backdooring it with Loki C2, getting setup with the client GUI, and we even came up with two ways to keep the app running persistently in the background 🪄 -- Cursor runs normally from the end users perspective! 🥷

## 🪄 Description
At runtime, an Electron application reads JavaScript files, interprets their code and executes them within the Electron process. The animation below demonstrates how the Microsoft Teams Electron application reads a JavaScript file at runtime, which then uses the Node.JS `child_process` module to execute `whoami.exe`.  

![](docs/images/electron6.gif)

Since Electron applications execute JavaScript at runtime, modifying these JavaScript files allows attackers to inject arbitrary Node.js code into the Electron process. By leveraging Node.js and Chromium APIs, JavaScript code can interact with the operating system.

Loki was designed to backdoor Electron applications by replacing the applications JavaScript files with the Loki Command & Control JavaScript files.

For more information see my blog post about backdooring Electron applications with Loki C2:  

- [Bypassing Windows Defender Application Control with Loki C2](https://www.ibm.com/think/x-force/bypassing-windows-defender-application-control-loki-c2)

## Features & Details
- Uses Azure Storage Blobs for C2 channel.
  - All C2 messages are AES encrypted with dynamically created AES keys.
  - SAS Token to protect C2 storage account.
- Proxy-aware agent.
  - Uses Chromium renderer child processes for agent, shellcode execution, and assembly fork-n-run style execution, so inherits proxy-aware capabilities of Chromium.
- Teamserver-less
  - Unlike traditional C2's where agents send messages to a Teamserver, there is no Teamserver.
  - The GUI client & agents both checkin to the same data-store for commands and output. 
- Hidden window and does not show in taskbar after execution, Loki process is run in background.
  - Can stay alive for months calling back until the computer is restarted.
- Robust exception handling in kernel process, if agent child process dies from an exception or bug then kernel spawns a new agent process. 

### Commands
_All agent commands are written in native Node.JS and do not require additional dependencies or library load events. With the exception of the `scexec` and `assembly` commands which do a library load on `keytar.node` and `assembly.node`_
- All commands accept paths using `/`, `\` in paths will not work.

| `set`       | Set the Node load paths for assembly node and scexec nodes                 |  

#### `Set` - Loading Nodes from Application Control Exclusion Paths
- If there are application control rules preventing library loads for the node files you can use the `set` command to change the load paths for `assembly.node` and `scexec.node`. 
- By using `ls`, `cat`, `cp` and `mv` you may be able to enumerate the application control rules to discover a writable directory that is an exclusion. 
- With this you can put the node files in the exclusion directory and use the `set` command to change their load path to the exclusion directory to bypass the application control.

## 🧙‍♂️ Deploy Illusions 
First you need to identify a vulnerable Electron application which does not do ASAR security integrity checks such as `Microsoft Teams`. Newer applications may have integrity checks preventing backdooring. Older versions of the target app are more likely to be vulnerable.

[+] Payload ready!
         - Obfuscated payload in the ./app directory
```
#### Step 3 : Backdoor Electron Application
- Your obfuscated Loki payload is output to `./app/`
- Change directory to the `{ELECTRONAPP}/resources/`  
- Delete everything
- Copy the Loki `./app/` folder to `{ELECTRONAPP}/resources/app/`
- Click the Electron PE file and make sure Loki works

#### Step 4 : Configure Loki Client
- Launch the Loki GUI client
- From the menubar click `Loki Client > Configuration` to open the Settings window
- Enter in your Storage Account details and click `Save`

- The agent should now render in the dashboard
- Click the agent from the dashboard table to open the agent window
- Test to ensure Loki works properly


## Backdooring Electron Apps and Keeping the real Application Working as Normal
The most straightforward way to use Loki is to replace the files in `{ELECTRONAPP}/resources/app/` with the Loki files. This hollows out the app, meaning the app won't function normally -- Loki replaced its functionality.  

If you really want to keep the Electron application running and have it also deploy Loki in the background all hope is not lost! [John Hammond](https://x.com/_JohnHammond) and I figured out a way to keep the real Electron application running. We've added the file you will need to `/loki/proxyapp/init.js` in this repo.

It is currently setup to work for Cursor, discovered to be vulnerable by [John Hammond](https://x.com/_JohnHammond). 

For doing this you will need to:
- Download the Cursor app
- Paste all Loki files except `package.json` to `cursor/resources/app/`
  - Don't replace the real `package.json`
- Copy `/loki/proxyapp/init.js` to `cursor/resources/app/`
- Modify contents of `cursor/resources/app/package.json` to:
  - set `"main":"init.js",`
  - delete `"type":"module",`
  - delete `"private":true,`

### How this works
- With these changes `Cursor.exe` will load in `init.js` on click / execution
- `init.js` reads in `package.json`
- `init.js` changes `"main":"init.js",` -> `"main":"main.js",`
  - `main.js` is Loki
- `init.js` spawns and disowns a new `Cursor.exe` which points to Loki
- __Loki is spawned in the background__
- `init.js` reads in `package.json` again
- `init.js` changes `"main":"main.js",` -> `"main":"./out/main.js",`
  - `./out/main.js"` is the real Cursor application
- `init.js` spawns and disowns a new `Cursor.exe` which points to the real Cursor
- __Real Cursor app is spawned, visible and operates as normal__
- When Cursor is exited by the user:
  - `init.js` catches the exit
  - `init.js` reads in `package.json` for a third time
  - `init.js` changes `"main":"./out/main.js",` -> `"main":"init.js",`

This way the app is persistently backdoored and operates as normal. If the cursor app is exited loki will continue to run in the background.

### Future
I'll make a script to automate this in the future.

## Opsec Recommendations
- [Opsec Recommendations](docs/opsec/recommendations.md)

## Compilation Guides
These are the compile instructions for building the agents & clients. The instructions cover multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is recommended to compile the client on the target platform and architecture.

### Client
- [Windows](./docs/compile/client/windows.md)
- [macOS](./docs/compile/client/macos.md)
- [Linux](./docs/compile/client/linux.md)

### Agents
**If you are backdooring an Electron application then you don't need to compile agents.**  

I do not recommend compiling the agent and using it for operations. Agent compile instructions are for development. 

- [Windows](./docs/compile/agent/windows.md)
- [Linux](./docs/compile/agent/linux.md)
- [macOS](./docs/compile/agent/macos.md)

## Detection Guidance
- Review the information provided by MITRE for more details, examples, and information about this TTP :
  -  [MITRE ATT&CK T1218.015: Electron Applications](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/015/)
- Execution of an electron app from a abnormal directory such as `~/Downloads/Teams/Teams.exe`
- Electron apps beaconing to an Azure Storage Blob `*.blob.core.windows.net`
- SAS token usage in network traffic
- Electron apps spawning child processes such as `netstat.exe` or `whoami.exe`
- A directory with the name in the Loki `package.json` will be created in `~/AppData/Roaming/{NAME}` when the Loki JavaScript executes in the Electron process.
- This [LOLBAS Teams](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/OtherMSBinaries/Teams/) entry covers detections for Electron application backdooring. The detection information has been copied below.

- IOC: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Teams\current\app.asar` file created/modified by non-Teams installer/updater
